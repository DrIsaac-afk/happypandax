# Want to report an issue or suggest a feature?

This is the official issue-tracker for HPX. Please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/happypandax/happypandax/issues). 

# Where is the code?

Development on HPX will continue in private.
HPX will still be **free** and developed on just like always. The translations and documentation will stay open-source so that anyone is free to contribute if they want. Plugins will also stay open-source and can be found at the [plugin repo(https://github.com/happypandax/plugins).

**Why?**
No one was really contributing so I see no reason in HPX being open-source.
