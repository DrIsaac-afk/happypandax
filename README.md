# Where is the code?

On May 2018 I decided to pull down the source code for HPX as I saw no point in HPX being open-source.
I will continue working on HPX myself as I have always done. Virtually nothing will (and has) changed by this decision as I have always been the sole developer of HPX. I just now work behind closed doors as that's what I find most comfortable at the moment.
HPX will continue being free and updated just like always. The translations and documentation will stay open-source so that anyone are free to contribute if they want. Plugins will also stay open-source and can be found at the [plugin repo(https://github.com/happypandax/plugins).
